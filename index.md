# Hi, I'm Tobias Park
Welcome to my website.  

## Computer Science  
I am a Computer Science student at [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://rpi.edu), where I am earning both my B.S. (3.88 GPA, May 2021) and M.S. (May 2022) in Computer Science under [RPI's coterminal program](https://info.rpi.edu/co-terminal). My graduate advisor is [Dr. Stacy Patterson](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~pattes3/).    

I am proficient in Python, Java, and C++. I am primarily interested in the fields of algorithms and cloud computing.  

I am searching for full-time positions in industry after graduation.

## Photography  
I have a passion for amateur photography, even though I'm not super great at it. I mostly enjoy landscape photography.  

My equipment consists of a Nikon D5600, a Nikon 18-55mm VR f3.5-5.6 lens, a Super-Takumar 50mm f1.4 lens, and a Google Pixel 2 (I know, it's a smartphone, but it takes surprisingly good pictures sometimes!). I sometimes mount the 50mm lens on backwards for macro photography.

## Amateur Radio
I am a licensed amateur radio operator (Amateur Extra class license). My callsign is KD2EOM (hence the name of this website).  

I have made over 3,000 contacts with people in 6 continents and nearly 150 countries. I mostly enjoy digital modes such as PSK31, although I also operate on SSB.  

My grandfather, [KD1AB](https://www.qrz.com/db/kd1ab), was the second ham in South Korea to receive an amatuer radio license. He introduced me to the hobby as a teenager.

My equipment consists of a Yaesu FT-450D, a Kenwood TS-830S, a Cushcraft R6000 Vertical, and a Wouxun VHF/UHF handheld.
